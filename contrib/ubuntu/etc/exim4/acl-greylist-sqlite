GREYDB=/var/lib/exim4/mta-greylist.db

# ACL for greylisting. Place reason(s) for greylisting into a variable named
# $acl_m_greylistreasons before invoking with 'require acl = greylist_mail'.
# The reasons should be separate lines of text, and will be reported in
# the SMTP rejection message as well as the log message.
#
# When a suspicious mail is seen, we temporarily reject it and wait to see
# if the sender tries again. Most spam robots won't bother. Real mail hosts
# _will_ retry, and we'll accept it the second time. For hosts which are
# observed to retry, we don't bother greylisting again in the future --
# it's obviously pointless. We remember such hosts, or 'known resenders',
# by a tuple of their IP address and the name they used in HELO.
#
# We also include the time of listing for 'known resenders', just in case
# someone wants to expire them after a certain amount of time. So the
# database table for these 'known resenders' looks like this:
#
# CREATE TABLE resenders (
#        host            TEXT,
#        helo            TEXT,
#        time            INTEGER,
#    PRIMARY KEY (host, helo) );
#
# To remember mail we've rejected, we create an 'identity' from its sender
# and recipient addresses and its Message-ID: header. We don't include the
# sending IP address in the identity, because sometimes the second and
# subsequent attempts may come from a different IP address to the original.
#
# We do record the original IP address and HELO name though, because if
# the message _is_ retried from another machine, it's the _first_ one we
# want to record as a 'known resender'; not just its backup path.
#
# Obviously we record the time too, so the main table of greylisted mail
# looks like this:
#
# CREATE TABLE greylist (
#        id              TEXT,
#        expire          INTEGER,
#        host            TEXT,
#        helo            TEXT);
